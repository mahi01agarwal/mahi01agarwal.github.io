# About Me

👋 Hello, amazing people! I’m Mahima, an undergraduate student at CIC, University of Delhi, pursuing my B.Tech in IT and M.I. I am excited to announce that I’ve been selected for the Outreachy May 2024 to August 2024 internship round with Wikimedia!

## My Journey to Outreachy 🌟

Two years ago, I stepped into the world of IT engineering with a heart full of doubts and a mind brimming with curiosity. I questioned if this path was right for me after facing numerous setbacks. But, as Nelson Mandela once said, “The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.” This profound realization ignited my passion for IT and set me on this incredible journey.

During my second year, I discovered the immense possibilities in software programming beyond the confines of classroom assignments. Initially, open-source projects felt monotonous, but everything changed when I stumbled upon Outreachy. With the encouragement of mentors and past interns, I decided to dive into the world of open-source contributions.

## Why Outreachy? 🌍

Outreachy is unique because it values enthusiasm and commitment over academic achievements. The application process is designed to ensure that selected candidates are passionate and eager to learn. As Albert Einstein famously said, “The only source of knowledge is experience.” Outreachy offers a rich platform for experiential learning and growth.

## Project Overview 🛠️

I have been selected as an intern for Wikimedia, working with my mentors Pablo Aragón, Isaac Johnson, and Caroline Myrick on the project “Build a data visualization tool for the evolution of Wikipedia articles maintained by WikiProjects.” This project involves creating a tool to track the evolution of Wikipedia articles, empowering editors and researchers to understand the collaborative dynamics and growth patterns of Wikipedia content.

## A Little More About Me 🌈

Let me share what truly excites me: I’m deeply passionate about machine learning and deep learning. These fields are where data transforms into intelligent systems and actionable insights. Imagine training a neural network to recognize patterns or diving into advanced algorithms that predict outcomes with impressive accuracy. That’s my kind of adventure! Exploring these technologies excites me and keeps me learning and innovating. I’m eager to bring this passion to my Outreachy project!

## Core Values 🌟

- **Curiosity**: “The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence.” — Albert Einstein. Curiosity drives me to explore new ideas and technologies, pushing the boundaries of what I know.
- **Resilience**: “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.” — Winston Churchill. Resilience helps me navigate through challenges and emerge stronger.
- **Creativity**: “Creativity is intelligence having fun.” — Albert Einstein. Creativity fuels my problem-solving abilities and drives innovation.

## Conclusion 🚀

This blog marks the beginning of my exciting journey and motivations. Future posts will dive deeper into my project. Thank you for joining me on this adventure!

As the great Maya Angelou said, “You can’t use up creativity. The more you use, the more you have.” I look forward to sharing this creative journey with all of you! 🌈
